The 'new' gtf file is my ongoing attempt to add the second exon of the Small T transcript.

NC_001538.noOverlapRegions.noVP3.gtf - derivate of NC_001538.gtf where I
1. changed sT annotation to only the sT unique region in the intron
2. changed VP2 annotation to only the VP2 unique region upstream of VP1 (VP2
overlaps ~115bp of VP1 at VP1 5' end).
3. removed VP3
